## Required Packages
(Python 3.11 is required as py-cord does not yet support 3.12 and up)
```
pip install py-cord python-dotenv requests
```

## Set Up
Once you have the required packages installed, all you have to do is create a bot, and put your bot's token in the `.env` file then run `main.py`. The updater will keep your bot updated so there is no need for you to maintain the code. If you would like to maintain it and update it yourself, you can disable `auto_update` in the config.
